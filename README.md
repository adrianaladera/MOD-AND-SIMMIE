# MOD-AND-SIMMIE
Our numerical modeling and simulation project-- very slay, very sexy.

With the ever-increasing use of low-Earth orbit for commercial purposes, the concurrent growth of the space debris population poses a heightened threat to the safety and operations of spacecraft in orbit due to potential collisions. In order to mitigate the effect of space debris, a clearer understanding of the environment is needed. This project develops a numerical simulation of spacecraft maneuvering to avoid debris, aiming to provide a better picture of the negative impacts to space infrastructure as a function of the number of extant debris. The heart of the the model is a dynamical simulation based on the equations of orbital mechanics, along with a satellite-level "controller" (built-in to the equations of motion) that guides active satellites away from debris.

Numerical methods: trapezoidal and forward Euler time integration, homotopy continuation, $N$-dimensional Newton
